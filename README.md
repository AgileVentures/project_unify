###Background
More than 700,000 refugees have made their way across the Mediterranean to Europe. The conflict in Syria continues to be by far the biggest driver of migration. But the ongoing violence in Afghanistan, abuses in Eritrea, as well as poverty in Kosovo and other regional conflicts are also leading people to look for new lives elsewhere. Many of the newly arrived refugees are highly skilled individuals, often with extensive professional experience. Others are young people who, because of war and the risk of persecution, was forced to interrupt their university studies.

I see the current migration situation as an opportunity for our societies to grow. I think that we can all benefit from people choosing Europe as their new home. But I also acknowledge that there are obstacles along the way when trying to settle down in a new country - in a different culture and different customs and traditions.

I have for some time been thinking of ways to assist refugees in their efforts to integrate into their new communities with help of technology and software. I think one of the areas which can benefit from technology, is assistance with integration into professional life and career development.

I would like to put together a team of developers and build a platform for established software engineers to get in touch with technically trained and interested migrants in order to help them start building their personal professional networks - which we all know are very important when entering the labor market.

I have a vision of an application that helps people get in touch and start interacting depending on interests, geographic location, age, and more.

It is my belief that it is a project that fits AgileVentures.org and that together we can create an interesting solution that will help at least some of the many people who long for a new, safe life in Europe.
